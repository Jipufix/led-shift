# Verilog LED Shifter Project

## Description
This project implements an LED shifter using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** approach with **1-hot encoding**. The design consists of two main modules: the **main LED shifter** and the **shift register**. It is designed to shift LEDs left or right based on specific states and incorporates a 1 Hz strobe signal for slower clock speed.

## Features
- **Finite State Machine design** with 1-hot encoding for state management.
- **1 Hz strobe signal** to enable slower clock speed operations.
- Modular design with separate components for the **LED shifter** and **shift register**.
- Supports shifting LEDs **left or right** based on input conditions.
- Includes bug fixes for:
  - Proper output register updates in the shift register.
  - Addressing unconsidered scenarios in the FSM design.

## Files
The project includes the following files:
- `shift_reg.v`: Verilog code for the shift register module.
- `led_shift.v`: Verilog code for the main LED shifter module.

## Usage
To use this project:
1. Upload the provided Verilog files (`shift_reg.v` and `led_shift.v`) to your FPGA development environment.
2. Simulate the design to verify its functionality.
3. Deploy it onto an FPGA board to observe the LED shifting behavior.

## How It Works
The project uses a **1 Hz strobe signal** generated by counting clock cycles, ensuring that signals are updated once per second. The FSM controls the states of the LED shifter, starting from the "CLEAR" state and transitioning through other states based on input conditions. The shift register handles the actual shifting of LEDs either left or right.

## Bug Fixes
During development, several bugs were resolved:
- Ensuring that shifted registers are properly assigned to output registers.
- Addressing missing scenarios in the FSM design that caused unexpected halts.
