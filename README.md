# led-shift
This project implements an LED shifter using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** approach with **1-hot encoding**. The design consists of two main modules: the **main LED shifter** and the **shift register**. It is designed to shift LEDs left or right based on specific states and incorporates a 1 Hz strobe signal for slower clock speed.
